# Snake Game in Go 🐍

A classic Snake game built entirely in Go, running directly in your terminal.

This project was created after learning the Go programming language, as a way to apply and strengthen fundamental Go concepts such as goroutines, channels, structs, and real-time input handling.

It is designed for smooth performance and flicker-free rendering, by only redrawing changed characters (buffered rendering) and using goroutines to process non-blocking keyboard input.
